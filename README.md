### Hi I'm gh0stbadb0y ! :-) 👋

- 🔭 Working on java development. 
- 🌱 Learning cyber security.
- 🤔 Breaking the limits of the circle .

### Tips! 😄

我不能保证写的每个地方都是对的，但是至少能保证每一句话、每一行代码都经过了认真的推敲、仔细的斟酌。每一篇文章的背后，希望都能看到自己对于技术、对于生活的态度。

I can't guarantee that every place I write is correct, but at least I can guarantee  that every sentence and line of code has been carefully considered. Behind every article, I hope to see my attitude towards technology and life.
